//! Pivot tables: what a sheet's pivot says about itself, and where its data
//! came from.
//!
//!
//! **Written by comparison.** A report or cache the program did not touch
//! goes back byte for byte: a pivot is bound to its cache, its records and the
//! versions that wrote them, and nothing rebuilt from this summary is as good
//! as what arrived. One that was changed or made in code is written from the
//! model the way excelize writes a new pivot: the cache without its records
//! and marked `refreshOnLoad`, so the application that opens the file lays
//! the report out again from the source range. A report removed from a sheet
//! takes its part with it; its cache stays for the reports still using it.
